Subject: AI Engineering Intern Application

Dear Hiring Team at OpenAI,

I am writing to express my interest in the AI Engineering Intern position at OpenAI. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at The NorthCap University, graduating in 2026.

My work at DRDO and Constems-AI Systems has given me hands-on experience in developing intelligent systems and analytics platforms. At DRDO, I built a full-stack palm vein authentication system powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Flask APIs. I also developed aerial object recognition models using deep learning and image processing techniques. This work strengthened my understanding of computer vision workflows and deploying deep learning in real-world environments.

At Constems-AI, I created dynamic dashboards in Tableau and Power BI and worked on end-to-end data preprocessing pipelines using Python and SQL to derive actionable insights.

In other projects, I built a hybrid music recommendation engine using NLP models (BERT, Word2Vec), audio analysis (Librosa), and PySpark ETL pipelines with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CockroachDB. These experiences reflect my passion for solving complex problems using software engineering, machine learning, and data engineering.

My skill set includes Python, SQL, Java, and full-stack development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React.js. I am also experienced with ML libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn), data tools (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), and cloud environments. I work comfortably with version control (Git) and core software principles like OOP, data structures, and system design.

I deeply admire OpenAI’s reputation for innovation and would be thrilled to contribute meaningfully in a rigorous, collaborative environment. I’m eager to start in a role where I can learn continuously and grow into a full-time position.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Anjori Sarabhai
